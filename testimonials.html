              Our experience with Green Thumb Landscaping was awesome! They
              repaired our landscaping in St. Albert. Christopher Watson, in
              particular, was professional, polite and hardworking. He wanted to
              make sure we were happy with the job every step of the way! Thank
              you Green Thumb Landscaping for a job well done! Great job
              Christopher!

              One time, they cut my lawn too short, it turned a bit brown, but
              they've been good ever since.

              I would personally like to extend my gratitude to Parks
              Landscaping Limited for the incredible work they did for my yard
              in the Newcastle area. Not only did the crew work diligently to
              complete my yard in a timely fashion, they were very nice and
              polite and went out of their way to ensure everything that I asked
              for was done. They were extremely patient with the issues raised
              regarding some of the neighbours concerns. They were also always
              asking me if there was anything more they could do which made me
              feel that they genuinely wanted to do their best work. The
              landscaping crew as a whole was beyond fantastic and extremely
              polite and professional. In particular, I want to thank Matt &
              Jimmy (who worked on the fence and deck) for being outstanding
              employees. They not only fixed and addressed all of my concerns
              but they went out of their way to make sure everything was
              completed at a high standard. For example, I had mentioned a
              concern about the grass (even though they were not the ones who
              put it in) and the next day they brought new sod in and replaced
              the bad parts. I would also like to extend my gratitude to Chad,
              as he too went above and beyond to organize everything I asked
              for. From putting up with all of my phone calls, to following up
              with all my changes; he made sure our new yard and deck was taken
              care of. I wanted to write this letter expressing how much I
              appreciate all of the crew‚Äôs hard work, and how impressed I am
              with Green Thumb Landscaping Limited.

              Green Thumb Landscaping took charge and made my landscaping
              happen. I had no clue of how to set up my yard, but they came and
              gave me an awesome plan and executed. The city had put
              requirements on my property that needed to be met. I was unsure on
              how to meet the requirements and stay within my budget. After a
              brief meeting with a park representative they had created a plan
              that to fulfill the requirements and had booked a time to finish
              the job. A great thing when you are spending so much money is to
              see the crew actually working swiftly and not taking long breaks.
              Park‚Äôs guys worked straight until dark each day to finish the job.
              I would totally recommend Green Thumb Landscaping to anyone. In
              fact, I did recommend them to a neighbour down the street. He went
              with Park because they were able to deliver a prompt and
              professional service. Thank you Green Thumb Landscaping for a job
              well done!

              We were very impressed. We‚Äôve done a lot of work to our home and
              property and this has been by far one of the best experiences!
              They met or exceeded expectations every step of the way. The
              planning process was fun, the job started the day we‚Äôd planned for
              and the crew was fantastic, working full days until they were
              done, and touching base with me whenever there were decisions to
              be made (no matter how minor). We had a patio area put in for our
              fire pit, added walkways, pea gravel and mulch to the surrounding
              area and they levelled the lawn and put down new sod. The work was
              top notch. Even more telling of the high level of professionalism
              is the care they put into follow up. They‚Äôve contacted us, come
              out to the house to take a look after the fact and actually asked
              for feedback to help them do better in the future. I wish all
              companies cared about their craft as much as the team at Green
              Thumb Landscaping Ltd. When we‚Äôre ready to tackle the front yard
              we will definitely be working with them again and we would highly
              recommend them to others üôÇ

              I have used landscapers before and they are a very professional
              group. They showed up on time, did fast work and cleaned up after
              every day. They took the time to ask me questions while ensuring
              what I wanted was completed. Great job and I would recommend this
              company.
